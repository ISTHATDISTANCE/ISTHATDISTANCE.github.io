<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/multi-language-al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
My research interest is to study how to extend human's ability or increase their performance and engagement on a wide range of **tasks** through different **environments**. My goal is to <ins>design interactions that maximize the power of the environment and minimize the difficulty of the task.</ins> The environments I touched in my past research are primarily *extended reality* and *mobile platforms*, and some tasks I have been working on are *data visualization* and *data collections*.

In the future, I'm going to approach my goal by exploring how **algorithms** can be incorporated in the environment to support more personalized and situated interactions.
